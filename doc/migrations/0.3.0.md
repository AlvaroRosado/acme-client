# Migration from 0.2.x to 0.3.x

If you used this client before `0.3.0` via the command line, nothing should change with this release. It is an internal rewrite to Amp v2, which is the underlying concurrency framework.

If you're depending on this package's internals, some things might have changed slightly. A detailed changelog can't be provided. My focus is the public command line API.
